# Agile, SCRUM and Kanban

## Agile
### Values
- Individuals and Interactions Over Processes and Tools
- Working Software Over Comprehensive Documentation
- Customer Collaboration Over Contract Negotiation
- Responding to Change Over Following a Plan
### Principles
- Customer satisfaction through early and continuous software delivery.
- Accommodate changing requirements throughout the development process.
- Frequent delivery of working software.
- Collaboration between the business stakeholders and developers throughout the project.
- Support, trust, and motivate the people involved.
- Enable face-to-face interactions.
- Working software is the primary measure of progress.
- Agile processes to support a consistent development pace.
- Attention to technical detail and design enhances agility.
- Simplicity.
- Self-organizing teams encourage great architectures, requirements, and designs.
- Regular reflections on how to become more effective. 

## SCRUM
### Scrum Framework
- Product backlog
- Sprint planning
- Sprint backlog
- Scrum team
- Daily scrum
- Sprint review
- Sprint retrospective
- Increment
- Very similar to Agile, it is based on continous learning and adjustment to fluctuating factors
- The speed of agile and accuracy of devops combine to generate optimal deployment of products

### Roles, Artifacts, Ceremonies
#### Roles
- Product Owner
- Scrum Master
- Development Team
#### Artifacts
- Product Backlog
- Sprint Backlog
- Burn-Down Chart Sprint
- Increment
#### Ceremonies
- Sprint Planning
- Daily Scrum
- Sprint Review
- Sprint Retrospective

### 3 Amigos
- Business - What problem are we trying to solve?
- Development - How might we build a solution to solve that problem?
- Testing - What about this, what could possibly happen?

## Epic and User Story
### What is an epic story?
An epic is a large framework that cannot be delivered with one iteration, so has to be split into smaller ones. They are useful as they allow the big picture and end goal of the particular project to be set out very clearly.

- Use Case
  - Actor: consumer of an app
  - System: Create a some larger stories that comprise of smaller user stories
  - Goal: prevent focussing on too finer details and keep the end goal of the project in tact
### What are User stories?
User stories articulate how a software feature will value the user. The team often divides the project up into functional increments" (user stories). These stories should have non-technical language, explaining what the developers and building, why they are building, and what value it creates.

- Use Case
  - Actor: Player of a phone game application
  - System: create a user story of the visual design of the home page
  - Goal: Player has great first impressions when opening the game for the first time.

### How to Epic and User Stories fit in with Agile and Scrum?
- In agile, the User story is the smallest unit of work.
- The scrum backlog is split up into User stories, and realised through sprints. They originally just explain the desired outcome with requirements added later on in the process.
- The larger goals (Epic story) are split up into multiple user stories, completed with multiple iterations/Sprints
- All the epic stories together make up the initiative

### Why create user stories
Stories keep the focus on the user
Stories enable collaboration
Stories drive creative solutions
Stories create momentum
